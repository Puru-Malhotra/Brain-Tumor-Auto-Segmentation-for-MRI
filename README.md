# Brain-Tumor-Auto-Segmentation-for-MRI

Building a neural network to automatically segment tumor regions in brain, using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans.

The MRI scan is one of the most common image modalities that we encounter in the radiology field.

We will perform:

Standard data preparation techniques for MRI datasets
Metrics and loss functions for segmentation
Visualizing and evaluating segmentation models


For each corresponding image, it will be seperated into Voxels.
Each Voxel will be labelled and categorized into one of the following categories:

1: background

2: edema

3: non-enhancing tumor

4: enhancing tumor
